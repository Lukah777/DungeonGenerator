# DungeonGenerator
Medieval dungeon crawler where the player may select a starting race and item, and they will adventure through a randomly generated dungeon populated with different enemies, each of which drops unique loot. There would be a simple stats system and an inventory where you can equip or consume the items they find in the dungeon. The dungeon layouts are stored externally in the form of a number string, made easy to edit, and then loaded into the game once played.

# Controls

Press P to use Potion.

Mouse to rotate.

Left click to attack.

Run into items to swap what is equipped, and run into stat spheres to increase stats.
